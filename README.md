# Net Patrol

Net Patrol is a small userspace daemon to get detailed bandwidth stats for Ubuntu 14.04 and hopefully it should work in other distros too!

## Genesis

I know there are other tools like `vnstat`, etc. but I needed more detailed stats, especially process/app wise consumption of bandwidth (as you get in Android). As of today, the tool is still under development, I'll update this page with installation details and other things as and when needed.
